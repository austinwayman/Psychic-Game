# Psychic-Game

This is a game where you type a letter to try to guess the randomized letter that the program generates.

You get 7 tries and if you guess the letter correctly then you receive an alert that states, "good job!". If you guess incorrectly 7 times then the game restarts. The program also lists the guessed letters.
